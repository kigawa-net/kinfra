# When a Task is Completed

After completing any code changes, run the following commands to ensure quality:

1. **Format code**: `./gradlew ktlintFormat`
2. **Check style**: `./gradlew ktlintCheck`
3. **Run tests**: `./gradlew test`
4. **Build project**: `./gradlew build`

If any step fails, fix the issues and re-run.

For commits, ensure changes are staged and committed appropriately.
